# Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
**Duration:** Weeks 1-3 (3 weeks)  
**Budget Allocation:** $25,000 (5%)

## 1.1 Objectives

| Objective | Measurable Goal |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Complete codebase audit | 100% code coverage analysis |
| Document current architecture | Full system diagram with all dependencies |
| Define migration roadmap | 10-phase plan with milestones |
| Establish team structure | All 10 roles assigned and onboarded |
| Set up project management | Jira/Linear board with all epics |
| Baseline performance metrics | Current LCP, FCP, TTI documented |
| Risk assessment | All risks identified with mitigation plans |

## 1.2 Prerequisites

- [ ] Access to GitHub repository (https://github.com/Kaashmalik/mtk-ssl2026.git)
- [ ] Team of 10 developers recruited and available
- [ ] Budget approval ($500K-$1M)
- [ ] Stakeholder alignment on 2025 transformation goals
- [ ] Development environment licenses (IDE, tools)
- [ ] Access to current production environment for analysis

## 1.3 Key Activities

### Week 1: Codebase Analysis

```bash
# Clone and analyze repository
git clone https://github.com/Kaashmalik/mtk-ssl2026.git
cd mtk-ssl

# Generate dependency analysis
npx madge --circular --extensions ts ./apps ./packages ./services > dependency-report.txt

# Code complexity analysis
npx plato -r -d ./reports ./apps ./packages ./services

# Security audit
npm audit --json > security-audit.json
npx snyk test --json > snyk-report.json
```

**Sub-tasks:**
1. Map all NestJS modules in `services/api/`
2. Document all API endpoints with request/response schemas
3. Identify shared code in `packages/` (ui, database, config)
4. Analyze Supabase schema in `supabase/migrations/`
5. Review all environment variables and secrets
6. Document third-party integrations (Clerk, Stripe, JazzCash)
7. Measure current bundle sizes for all apps
8. Run Lighthouse audits on all frontend apps

### Week 2: Architecture Design

**Service Decomposition Matrix:**

| Current Module | Target Service | Communication | Priority |
|----------------|----------------|---------------|----------|
| AuthModule | auth-service | gRPC | P0 |
| TournamentModule | tournament-service | gRPC + Kafka | P0 |
| ScoringModule | scoring-service | WebSocket + Kafka | P0 |
| PaymentModule | payment-service | gRPC + Kafka | P1 |
| AnalyticsModule | analytics-service | Kafka | P1 |
| NotificationModule | notification-service | Kafka | P2 |
| StreamingModule | streaming-service | WebRTC | P2 |
| AIModule | ai-commentary-service | gRPC | P3 |

### Week 3: Planning and Setup

1. Create detailed project timeline in Jira/Linear
2. Define sprint structure (2-week sprints)
3. Set up Confluence/Notion documentation
4. Create architecture decision records (ADRs)
5. Define coding standards and PR guidelines

## 1.4 Resources Needed

| Role | Count | Weekly Hours |
|------|-------|--------------|
| Tech Lead | 1 | 40 |
| Solution Architect | 1 | 40 |
| Backend Developers | 2 | 30 |
| Frontend Developer | 1 | 30 |
| DevOps Engineer | 1 | 30 |
| QA Engineer | 1 | 30 |
| Project Manager | 1 | 40 |
| Security Engineer | 1 | 20 |

## 1.5 Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Incomplete documentation | High | Medium | Interview original devs, trace code |
| Hidden technical debt | High | High | Comprehensive analysis, buffer time |
| Team skill gaps | Medium | High | Early training identification |
| Scope creep | High | High | Strict change control |

## 1.6 Success Metrics/KPIs

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Documentation completeness | 100% |
| Architecture diagrams | All 4 C4 levels |
| Risk register | 100% risks identified |
| Team onboarding | 10/10 members ready |

## 1.7 Post-Phase Review Checklist

- [ ] All architecture diagrams approved
- [ ] Current system fully documented
- [ ] All team members onboarded
- [ ] Project management tools configured
- [ ] Baseline metrics captured
- [ ] Risk register complete
- [ ] Phase 2 prerequisites identified
